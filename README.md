You need to complete a small assignment, so I can assess your skills.

Here is the assignment. It should be in React.js. No designing is required.

I want you to create a simple form with three columns 

1) Account Dropdown (Add some fake options)
2) Debit Amount 
3) Credit Amount


By default three rows should come. Users should be able to add new rows and delete any row. And a total of 2nd and 3rd column should be shown.

All values should be in an array  in state and on change of value, such array should be updated.

Below validation are also to be added.

1. Show amount in Indian number format like 12,24,249.86 if user moves from amount box.
2. Total should also be shown in Indian number format.
